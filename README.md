# flappy-bird-game-
A simple Flappy Bird–style arcade game built entirely in Java 🐦🎮.
This project uses core Java concepts such as OOP, event handling, and graphics rendering to recreate the classic tap-to-fly gameplay with obstacle generation, collision detection, and score tracking.
Designed to be lightweight, beginner-friendly, and easy to run, it’s a great example of game development using pure Java (no external libraries).
